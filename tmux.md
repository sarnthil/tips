# tmux tips

## Show a clock

`prefix + t` puts a clock in the current pane. Press any key to continue.

## Creating windows

`prefix + c` makes a new (empty) window. To put the current pane in a new (its
own) window, `prefix+!` does the job.

## Zooming into a pane

`prefix + z` makes the current pane as big the current window (temporarily).
Same to zoom out.
